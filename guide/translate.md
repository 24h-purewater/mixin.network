# For Translators

## Multilingual Support

Both the interface and the page content on this website are available in multiple languages.

The translation files of the interface are stored in JSON format in `/docs/.vuepress/theme/lang`.

The pages for each language are stored in folders labeled with the language name under `/docs`.

for example, all French pages are organized in `/docs/fr` with the same structure as the original (English) version.

Here's a table to help you compare the differences: 

| Folder | English | Other languages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Community | /docs/community | /docs/{lang}/community |
| Developers | /docs/developers | /docs/{lang}/developers |
| Mixin Messenger | /docs/messenger | /docs/{lang}/messenger |
| Network | /docs/network | /docs/{lang}/network |

## Add new languages support

It's a little more difficult for regular contributors to add a new language.
To send the request, simply [create a new issue](https://github.com/fox-one/mixin.network/issues/new).
