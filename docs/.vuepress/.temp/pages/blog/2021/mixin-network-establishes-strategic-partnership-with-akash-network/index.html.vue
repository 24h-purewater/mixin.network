<p><img src="@source/blog/2021/mixin-network-establishes-strategic-partnership-with-akash-network/akash-mixin.png" alt="akash-mixin"></p>
<p>Mixin Network is glad to announce a strategic partnership with Akash Network, a distributed peer-to-peer marketplace for cloud compute. Launched in March 2021, Akash Network enables companies with spare compute capacity in on-premise or collocated data centers to lease their unused capacity for cloud deployments.</p>
<p>Together, both parties will conduct in-depth collaboration in market promotion, network construction, and global community expansion. Through this partnership, Mixin is integrating Akash into its multi-chain network ecosystem, bringing its vast number of community members into the Akash ecosystem and providing them access to the Akash Token (AKT), Akash Networks’ native utility token.</p>
<p>Mixin and Akash Network will work closely to explore opportunities to integrate their networks in ways that benefit the users and protect open platforms while reducing cost. This will include access to multiple decentralized applications on the Mixin Network, meaning AKT holders will have the chance to use AKT in practical application scenarios.</p>
<p>Both Akash and Mixin Network care deeply about their communities. Users are always welcome to join in, meet cryptocurrency friends, get the latest news about Akash Network, and get benefits from the secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure.
