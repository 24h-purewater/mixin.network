In contrast, Mixin&#39;s nodes achieve long-term stable profitability by charging separate Dapp API call fees, similar to AWS cloud services, ensuring the entire network&#39;s safe and stable continuous operation. It is also a must-have feature for commercial-grade public chains.</p><h2 id="core-technologies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#core-technologies" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Core technologies</h2><h3 id="cross-chain-ledger" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cross-chain-ledger" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Cross-chain ledger</h3><p>The sidechain synchronizes and listens to all Mixin-related transactions from the main chain. All external deposits, withdrawals, and internal transfers are recorded in a decentralized distributed ledger. In contrast, the main chain assets are transferred to a multi-signature address jointly managed by all nodes. Each record contains the following information: asset type (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), transfer amount, etc., and is tamper-proof and traceable. Mixin has no coin/token issuance, so there are no mainnet tokens, and no assets come out of thin air. <img src="'+h+'" alt="Cross-chain"> The Mixin cross-chain solution is somewhat similar to an exchange but with decentralized nodes that jointly manage assets, with open-sourced and transparent code and data, and a focus on one thing - transfer.</p><h3 id="directed-acyclic-graph-technology-dag" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#directed-acyclic-graph-technology-dag" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Directed Acyclic Graph Technology (DAG)</h3><p>Mixin adopts DAG as the underlying data structure model. Unlike other DAG public chains (e.g., IOTA, Bytaball, etc.), Mixin has no central authority node. The data does not need to wait for the final confirmation from the central authority node. It ensures efficient asynchronous operation by limiting the time of referencing data and guarantees the correctness of consensus results by Asynchronous BFT. It can be simply understood that each full node of Mixin is a chain with complete data, but the order of the data is different, and eventually all can derive the same result: <img src="'+c+'" alt="DAG"></p><h3 id="trusted-execution-environment-tee" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#trusted-execution-environment-tee" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)</h3><p>Mixin uses Intel SGX as the TEE implementation to further enhance security. All full nodes must run in a Trusted Execution Environment, ensuring that the &quot;coda for the full node running&quot; is &quot;the code it claims to be running.&quot; No one can change the running code in the trusted execution environment without being aware of it. <img src="'+l+'" alt="TEE"></p><h3 id="privacy-enhancements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#privacy-enhancements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Privacy Enhancements</h3><p>The privacy of UTXO transactions is enhanced by CryptoNote technology so that only the two parties to a transaction know about it. In other words, the full node cannot identify the two parties to the transaction, meaning that no specific parties to a transaction can be deduced from the transaction itself: <img src="'+p+'" alt="Privacy"> In summary: the finite number of PoS nodes, DAG, UTXO, Asynchronous BFT, CryptoNote, TEE, with these subtle combinations of technologies, it achieves data tamper-evidence and solves performance bottlenecks, double-spending, privacy, scalability, and other issues.</p><h2 id="node-network" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#node-network" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Node Network</h2><h3 id="full-nodes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#full-nodes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Full Nodes</h3><p>Full nodes are mainly responsible for bookkeeping, verifying, and signing each transaction.
