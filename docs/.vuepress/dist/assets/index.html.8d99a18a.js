It can improve scalability by transferring batches of transactions to a single transaction. Its essence is to compress the user state on the chain and store it in a Merkle tree and transfer the user state change to the chain while ensuring the user state change process\u2019s correctness through a Zero-Knowledge proof mechanism. The cost of directly processing user state changes on the chain is relatively high, but only using the smart contract on the chain to verify the correctness of a zero-knowledge proof is relatively low. In addition, the required remittance information is transmitted to the contract along with the certificate, which is convenient for users to verify accounts.</p><p>zkTube aims to become an indispensable Layer 2 environment builder and Layer 2 solution provider in Web3.0. The realization of the asset migration from Layer 1 to Layer 2 continuously iterates the technology, builds the underlying technical framework Lego for developers, and reduces development costs.</p><h2 id="about-mixin-network" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#about-mixin-network" aria-hidden="true">#</a> About Mixin Network</h2><p>Mixin Network is an open-source, lightning-fast, and decentralized Web3 platform to bring speed and scalability to the blockchain.
