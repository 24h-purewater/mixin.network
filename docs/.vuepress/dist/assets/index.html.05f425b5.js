Exin, as one of the most active developer teams in the Mixin ecosystem, owns the popular staking product ExinPool, which will join the Avalanche validator node ecosystem to provide secure and trusted staking and node services to the community.</p><p>ExinPool nodes have a queuing mechanism for joining and exiting (ignoring the rule that the 14-day locked period for staking), providing excellent liquidity and allowing users to participate in staking with zero thresholds and earn stable returns.</p><p>ExinPool encourages the community to participate in node co-construction and profit from the early-bird benefits in the early stages of the Avalanche node. Currently, the AVAX Staking Annualized Percentage Rate (APR) is about 10.08%. Users participating through ExinPool can enjoy super-high node revenue dividends while receiving additional AVAX, BTC, and EPC rewards during the campaign period.
